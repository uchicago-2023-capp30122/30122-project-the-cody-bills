WARD, ROTHMAN, YAW, LAUGHLIN, MARTIN, BAKER, ROBINSON, BARTOLOTTA, SCHWANK, PHILLIPS-HILL, STEFANO, L.

This fat is necessary in the daily diet and energy to support cell growth. Other health benefits of milk include improved bone health, lower blood pressure, and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes; and20230SR0048PN0368  - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930\nWHEREAS, The results of a Union City Area School District milk choice survey concluded that offering increased milk options would result in a 50% increase in milk consumption, a 95% reduction in milk waste, that 63.6% of the students would chose milk more often if they had the option to choose which milk fits their needs, that 84.7% of the students drink whole milk at home, which is why they do not choose milk at school, and that offering two additional milk fat options within school meals can significantly change the amount of milk chosen, consumed and not discarded; andWHEREAS, The evidence is overwhelming that both 2% and whole milk should also be offered to students in schools; andWHEREAS, The United States Department of Health and Human Services coordinates with the USDA in developing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; therefore be itRESOLVED, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the United States Department of Agriculture to include 2% and whole milk in the Nutrition Standards for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs and as a Smart Snacks option; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the United States Department of Health and Human Services to recommend to the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee to permit modifications to the standard for the inclusion of 2% and whole milk; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of Health and Human Services.20230SR0048PN0368  - 4 - 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728\n\n\n\n"
